## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a system using machine learning which provides wine recommendations to experienced and novice wine consumers. We will be covering the entire data science process, from exploratory data analysis to data cleaning and pre-processing to modeling and evaluation. The data used for this project has been obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews) and was scraped from a website called WineEnthusiast in 2017. Using this wine review data, we will be creating a Content-Based Recommender System and a Knowledge-Based Recommender System. 

## Files
*EDA & Visuals*: This file contains exploratory data analysis of the raw data file with some helpful visualizations of the data we will be working with

*Data Cleaning and Preprocessing*: This file is much more concise than the EDA & Visuals file and only contains the steps taken to ensure the data has been cleaned and prepared as needed so that it is ready to be used in future machine learning algorithms.

*Modeling*: This file contains the modeling and functions used to create different types of recommender systems. Regression and classification algorithms are used for content-based recommender systems. Cosine similarity calculations are used for a content-based recommender system as well as a case-based recommender system. A constraint-based recommender system is also included.

*Modeling - Clustering*: This file contains K Means clustering.
